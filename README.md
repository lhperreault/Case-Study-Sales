# Case-Study-Sales
This is a real life case study where I took a problem/inefficiency that myself and other coworkers were having and through trial and error I found a great solution. I am in an internship doing cold call sales for IT companies around the country, trying to get them business in their local area. Essentially, I and my team are sales reps for these IT companies. The goal for me is to find pain or interest in a call and book a meeting for the prospect and my CEO to meet and dive in deeper. 

In sales, it is important to understand the prospect you are calling the best you can. When you get a new list of contacts it takes time to go get this available info online through the many sources out there such as their website, FB, and LI. 
There are two main scenarios the companies I call have related to IT... the company has in-house IT or outsource it to an IT Company (MSP). Using Linked In Sales Navigator you can manual go on and see if this company has IT personal on staff. You can see when they started, the names of their positions, what they do, what software is used. You can find other CXO's in the company that might be decision makers. Finally, if you are wanting to take 10 min per contact you can see on LI Sales NAV if your prospect or other prospects in the company were in the news or posted recently on LI. 
As you can imagine, you can find a lot more great info by looking at their FB, website, X, Google My Business posts, or hiring websites.
The more info a sales rep can get the more personable and relevant he or she can come across when opening, asking questions, and pitching. If one was to really take the time to thoroughly go find all this info it would take about 15-20 a contact. 
Now, from what I understand most of my coworkers are gathering all this info, and mostly rely on the basics on LI Sales Nav which just takes 3 minutes a contact to gather. 
## Issue
The issue is the time it takes to research each prospect thoroughly is too long. With 200 prospect it would take 50 - 66 hours. Most of the guys have 4x200 contacts. This is why they only use at most 3 minutes to research a prospect. And many of them are doing it as they call which is not great because you lose focus and won't perform as well on a call. I felt this way as well. On days where I would have to research my contact as I went, I would make 50% of the calls I normally would and I wouldn't feel as focused and ready for an in-depth conversation. 

## Hypothesized Solution
I need to automate the research step of each prospect. I need to get the most available useful info out there. I need to display all this information efficiently allowing me to access, analyze, and use it when getting on a call.
